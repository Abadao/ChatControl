# This is the very first implementation of ChatControl's
# new custom rule engine codenamed ChatCeaser By Kangarko
#
# Accepts following operators (without <>)
# match <regex> (A valid regular expression string to match the message.)
# id <number/string> (Assign an id/name to the rule. Used in messages and handlers.)
# ignore string <string/regex> (If the message matches given string it will be ignored. 
#                               It only ignores the string if it's the only message in chat, as a protection against bypasses.)
# ignore event <chat/commands/signs> (If the rule triggers on specified event it will be ignored.)
# ignore perm <permission> (A permission to bypass the rule.)
# strip <regex> (A valid regular expression used to strip specified characters before the message is checked.)
# then replace <replacement> (A string that replaces the part of the checked message that matches the match.)
# then rewrite <message> (A message that replaces the entire checked message.)
# then deny (Cancel the player's message from appearing in the chat.)
# then console <command|command2|command3> (A commands to execute as the console. Use %player to get player name. Divide multiple commands by |)
# then warn <message> (A message that is displayed to the player.)
# then kick <optionalResaon> (If set, the player will be kicked with optional message.)
# then notify <permission> <message> (Send a message to all players with specified permission.)
# then fine <amount> (If plugin Vault is installed - take specified amount of money from the player.)
# then log (Caught message will be printed in console and saved in rules_log.txt)
# handle as <handler_name> (Launch actions specified in handlers.yml)
#
# Supports color codes with '&' character.
# Accepts unicode characters when saved in UTF-8 encoding (tested on Notepad++).

# IP filter. Notice the operator strip which removes specified characters BEFORE the message is checked.
