# It supports unicode characters, such as smileys
# but the file must be saved with UTF-8 encoding. Tested on Notepad++
# WordPad or Notepad on Windows are known to cause issues!
# You need to have ProtocolLib to enable these features!
# You can replace plugin or server messages, too.
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# Replace only parts of the messages, for example unicode.
